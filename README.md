## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for my Decision Tree Classifier project, developed during my internship at The Sparks Foundation. In this project, I implemented a Decision Tree Classification model to solve a real-world problem.

## Key Features

- **Machine Learning**: Utilized Decision Tree Classification for predictive analytics.
- **Data Exploration**: Explored the dataset to gain insights into the problem.
- **Accuracy**: Achieved high accuracy in classification tasks.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/shubhamkulal/decision-tree-classifier.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd decision-tree-classifier`
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
4. Open the `Decision_Tree_Classifier.ipynb` file and follow the instructions.

## Usage

You can use this project as a reference for implementing Decision Tree Classification in your own projects. The Jupyter Notebook provides step-by-step guidance.
